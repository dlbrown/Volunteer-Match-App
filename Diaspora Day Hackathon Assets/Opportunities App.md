# The client

The Peace Corps sends Americans abroad to tackle the most pressing needs of people around the world.



# The problem


---

Before: Applicants apply to Peace Corps, get matched by Peace Corps Headquarters to a program.

Now: Applicants apply to specific projects and countries.

---

Staying current with Peace Corps opportunities puts a heavy burden on potential applicants.

There are limited ways to engage with the datastream, feel connected to it, and be able to react to on-demand opportunities to serve.

# The solution

Help potential applicants see the range and scope of projects as well feel more connected to particular projects that match their skills and interests.


# The proposal

Create a 'matching' app or web interface that allows users to set up a profile of volunteer positions  in which they would be interested (for example, 'Environment' opportunitis in 'Togo'), as well as their qualifications ('2 years of French', Available to depart after May 1').

Then, using the newly-published Peace Corps API of Peace Corps Opportunities (volunteer spots), they can be 'matched' with opportunities that fit their interests and qualifications.


# Why you should care

Built with open tools, this could be scaled to other organizations and inputs that want to connect opportunities with volunteer assistance.
